Within this repository, we've tailored resources for students and professionals seeking to refine their SQL skills and advance in their careers. My exploration of (https://www.sql-practice.com) revealed it to be an educational and user-friendly website. However, a notable absence exists â€” a complete solution book is neither available on the website nor on GitHub. The good news? You can now access answers along with alternative solutions for every question.

I have used SQL Workbranch as main Database Management Systems (DBMS) and therefore you may encounter 
some queries that work in PostgreSQL may not work in other DBMS such as SQL Server or MySQL as some implementations slight vary in syntax.
For such cases, for example, in date and time operations I included standart SQL queries as well.


The test contains 50 questions and consists of 3 category:

Easy

Medium

Hard


You can use the following Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
to figure out what data to store, the entities, their attributes and also how entities relate to other entities.

select * from province_names;


1. Show all of the patients grouped into weight groups. Show the total amount of patients in each weight group. Order the list by the weight group decending. e.g. if they weight 100 to 109they are placed in the 100 weight group, 110-119 = 110 weight group, etc.

```

       CASE
           WHEN weight / POWER(height / 100.00, 2) >= 30

           END AS isobese
FROM patients;
```


3. Show patient_id, first_name, last_name, and attending doctor's specialty. Show only the patients who has a diagnosis as 'Epilepsy' and the doctor's first name is 'Lisa' Check patients, admissions, and doctors tables for required information.

```


4. All patients who have gone through admissions, can see their medical documents on our site.Those patients are given a temporary password after their first admission. Show the patient_id and temp_password.The password must be the following, in order:
patient_id
the numerical length of patient's last_name
year of patient's birth_date

```
--PostgreSQL
SELECT DISTINCT p.patient_id, CONCAT(a.patient_id, LENGTH(p.last_name), EXTRACT(YEAR FROM p.birth_date)) AS temp_password

5. Each admission costs $50 for patients without insurance, and $10 for patients with insurance. All patients with an even patient_id have insurance. Give each patient a 'Yes' if they have insurance, and a 'No' if they don't have insurance.Add up the admission_total cost for each has_insurance group.

```
SELECT CASE WHEN a.patient_id % 2 = 0 THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END AS has_insurance,

```


7. We are looking for a specific patient. Pull all columns for the patient who matches the following criteria:First_name contains an 'r' after the first two letters.

  Identifies their gender as 'F'

  Born in February, May, or December

  Their weight would be between 60kg and 80kg

  Their patient_id is an odd number

  They are from the city 'Kingston'


```
-- PostgreSQL
SELECT *

  AND weight BETWEEN 60 AND 80
  AND patient_id % 2 = 1
  AND city = 'Kingston';
```


8. Show the percent of patients that have 'M' as their gender. Round the answer to the nearest hundreth number and in percent form.

```
SELECT CONCAT(ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'M' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2), '%')
FROM patients;


SELECT ROUND(100 * AVG(gender = 'M'), 2) || '%' AS percent_of_male_patients

FROM admissions
GROUP BY admission_date;
```
